Background
NaCCER, the R&D arm of CIL, plays a pivotal role in fostering research and innovation in the coal sector. It receives a large volume of research proposals from premier institutions across India, for funding by the Ministry of Coal (MoC) and Coal India Limited (CIL). The evaluation process of these proposals is rigorous, involving multiple layers of scrutiny to assess technical feasibility, financial viability, novelty, and relevance to the coal industry. Currently, the initial screening is conducted at NaCCER, followed by expert review within CIL, as per the S&T guidelines. Given the increasing number of proposals and the complexity of manual evaluation, the process is becoming time-intensive and error-prone.

Description
At present, each R&D proposal submitted to NaCCER undergoes comprehensive manual scrutiny. This includes detailed reading, financial assessment, technical feasibility analysis by domain experts within CMPDIL/CIL, and novelty checks using manually maintained Word and Excel databases. These steps demand significant human effort, subjectivity, and time. Moreover, the approval workflow involves apex committee and R&D Board meetings for CIL funding and SSRC/TSC for MoC funding, which meet only a few times a year. Any oversight or missing information during initial scrutiny may result in the rejection of high-potential proposals, or delays due to prolonged correction cycles. These limitations highlight the need for a standardized, efficient, and intelligent evaluation mechanism.

Expected Solution
An AI/ML-based auto-evaluation system can significantly enhance the R&D proposal review process. The system should be capable of benchmarking submitted proposals against a structured database of past and ongoing projects to assess novelty. It should also be able to perform automated financial checks in line with S&T funding guidelines. By generating an objective evaluation score for each proposal, the system will streamline selection and rejection decisions, improve consistency, eliminate manual biases, and reduce processing time. This digitized approach will not only standardize evaluations but also ensure transparency and credibility in the funding decision process.
